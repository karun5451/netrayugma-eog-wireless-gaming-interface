# NetraYugma: EOG & IMU Gaming Controller

Welcome to NetraYugma, an innovative project that combines Electrooculography (EOG) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) technologies to create an immersive gaming experience. This repository contains the codebase for building a wireless game controller using an ESP32 microcontroller, MPU6050 IMU sensor, and the BIOAMP EOG pill.

## Features

- Transform your eye movements into precise joysticks using EOG technology.
- Utilize hand gestures with IMU sensors for intuitive control.
- Wireless communication through ESP32's WiFi and BLE capabilities.
- Customizable control settings over WiFi.
- Open-source collaboration for creativity and innovation.

## Getting Started

1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the ESP32, MPU6050, and BIOAMP EOG pill as per the provided schematics.

2. **Software Installation:**
   - Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) for a hassle-free development experience.
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. **Configuration:**
   - Customize your control settings in the `config.h` file.
   - Modify WiFi and BLE settings as needed.

4. **Upload Firmware:**
   - Use PlatformIO to build and upload the firmware to your ESP32.
   - Monitor the serial output for debugging and status updates.

## Usage

- Power on the NetraYugma controller.
- Follow the setup instructions on the display.
- Use your eyes for precise control and hand gestures for additional actions.
- Customize controls via WiFi for a personalized gaming experience.
